        The Battle of Badr, fought on 17th Ramadan in 2 AH (624 CE), was the first major battle in Islamic history. It was a decisive victory for the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his followers against the Quraysh of Mecca. Despite being outnumbered three to one, the Muslim army, consisting of approximately 313 fighters, triumphed due to their strategic positioning and strong faith.

        This battle is often seen as a turning point in Islamic history, solidifying the position of the Muslim community in Medina.
